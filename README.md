## Overview of the Analysis

Then purpose of this analysis was to predict financial loan data, we had two classes we were trying to predict healthy loans and high risk loans.
We used logistic regression model

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
  * Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.
Logistic regression model.accurACY=99%,precision for healthy loan 1.00.
Precision for high risk loan 0.86.
Recall for healthy loan 1.00.
Recall for high risk loan 0.91




  

## Summary

**Answer:** the logistical regression model is perfect in predicting the zero classification (healthy loans).
the model was not as good at predicting high risk loans as you can see from the 85%.
overall,the logistic regression model produced relative accurate predictions
